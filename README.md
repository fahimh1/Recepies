# Recepies



It’s a program by which a user can read, create
and delete recipes from a database. Before you start, you need to create a folder directory in
the base folder of your computer: it is a folder called Recipes, which contains four subfolders
and each of them contains two text files. Inside the files, you can write whatever you want. It's
not important what it says in each in each text file for this exercise. If you prefer, you can
download and unzip the file that we've attached to this lecture and place it in the root directory,
if you don't feel like building out that structure yourself. Once you have done that, here comes
your task

**How it works**

1. Option 1 will ask the user “Which category do you choose?” Meats, salads, desserts…
whatever categories you want. And once the user chooses a category, it will ask them
“Which recipe do you want to read?” And then it will show the content of that recipe.
2. Option 2 is getting the user to create a new recipe in a specific category: it will also
ask the user to choose a category, but then it will ask the user to write the name and
content of a new recipe, and it will create that file in the correct place.
3. Option 3 will ask for the name of the category the user wants to create and will generate
a brand new folder, a new category with that name.
4. Option 4 will delete recipes: it’ll do the same as option one, but instead of reading the
recipe, it will delete it.
5. Option 5 will let the user delete a category, asking “Which category do you want to
delete?”
6. Option 6 will end the execution of the code (just end the program). 

‘wrap’ the code inside a while loop
 use system to clean the console
 search the documentation for more methods
 compartmentalize the code into many functions
